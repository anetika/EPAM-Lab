Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark
Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
